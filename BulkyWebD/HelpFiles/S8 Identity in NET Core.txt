110. Scaffolding Error
If you have issues with scaffolding make sure you have updated NuGet package explained in 
lecture 91  - Depereciated NuGet Package (Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ViewFeatures)

errors:
Try clearing the NuGet cache using PM
dotnet nuget locals all --clear
, and then try to add your package.

If that doesn't work, try deleting the NuGet.config file present inside 
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\NuGet directory, and then restore it using 
dotnet restore
command in PM manager. Try adding your package after this.


111. Scaffold Identity Implementation

Identity is registration. login, credentials, tables, security, etc

C:\DEV_Training\C#\Udemy\ASP.NET Core MVC - The Complete Guide 2023 [NET8]\Bulky\Bulky.DataAccess\Data\ApplicationDbContext.cs
First need to do some DbContext Configuration:

    //public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext //this is from using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
    public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext //this is from using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore

Application will fail, so you need to add this line in any OnModelCreating() in ApplicationDbContext.cs

        protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
        {
            base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);
            ...

Install NuGet package and add using statement:
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore (7.0.15 in this project)

Add scaffolding:
BulkyBookWeb, right click, new scaffolding item, choose Identity
